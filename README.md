# AI Image Generator

  An AI image generator app is a software application that utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to generate images or manipulate existing images in a creative and often realistic manner. These apps leverage deep learning techniques, particularly generative models, to produce visually appealing and novel visual content. One popular type of generative model used in such applications is the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).
